      <description>Introduction The final project of this course focuses on the prediction of choice behavior in a space of choice tasks that extends the space considered by Erev et al. (2023). The participants in Erev et al.â€™s study did not receive a description of the keys, and had to base their decisions on the feedback provided after each choice. The current space includes similar tasks (but with only two keys), and also considers tasks in which part of the keys are described.</description>

      <description>Introduction Preprocess and split the dataset in an appropriate way via Python such that we can evaluate our model properly.
Explore the data through descriptive statistics and visualization and summarize findings about the data.
Develop three different models and train them on the training set. Find a proper way to combine the prediction results of these models.
Compare the models as well as the ensemble results using appropriate performance metrics.</description>

      <description>Introduction Define the phenomenon of interest. Build a generative model of the data that captures the impact of the phenomenon. Use (2) to build a statistical model. Incorporate prior knowledge into (3). Validate (3) with simulated data from(2). Use (3) to analyze real data and learn about the phenomenon. Evaluate and update the model. Link Link to the Dataset

      <description>Introduction Originally, when utilizing normal covariance to do asset allocation, the noise of the data will greatly affect the final allocation result, but Prof. Ledoit and Prof. Wolf found a simple method to solve this problem so that the result is more stable and will not be affected by the historical data noise.
